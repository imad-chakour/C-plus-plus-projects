# C++ Projects Repository

Welcome to the **C++ Projects Repository**. This repository contains multiple C++ projects that demonstrate various concepts and algorithms implemented in C++. Each project is a separate directory with its own set of files and instructions.

## Projects

- **Agencia Project**: A C++ program for a simple agency system (task management, client management, etc.).
- **Hotel System**: A project that simulates a hotel booking system with features like room reservation, guest management, and payment processing.
- **Zoo Project**: A simulation of a zoo management system that handles animal data, feeding schedules, and visitor information.

## Requirements

To run the C++ projects, you will need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or VSCode)

## Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
